# Dima's mod
## What's Dima's mod?
Dima's mod is in a way remade Minecraft which has:
<p align=left><br>- modloader (which is compatible with ANY normally written Fabric/Forge/Quilt mod), 
<br>- Better custom servers,
<br>- A world "HUB" system.
<br>- Support for Minecraft multiplayer as a "legacy" system (offline & online)
<br>- In-game version switcher
<p align=center><br>And all of it is done thru "modules". 

## About possible copyright issues
To be honest i have no idea if i am allowed to use Minecraft assets <b>(not code)</b>...
<br>But i do belive if there are modloaders, modpacks, fan-creations, etc. utilizing Minecraft assets AND code
<br>This project should be safe and sound

## Why is this being created
<p align=left> 

### Reason one:
I want to create a "superior" version of Minecraft which will be like Garry's mod for Source engine
<br>i.e. Dima's mod is a platform which allows easier customization of Minecraft  

### Reason two:
I don't like the difficulty of using current modloader APIs + maintaining all versions for all modloader APIs (for example you want to make a Fabric mod for 1.16.5+. The problem is that you need to port mods to every new version which is pretty hard. Or ever worse: youj want to maintain a mod for Fabric and Forge for 1.12.2+.)

### Reason three:
From my point of view in 2022 mojang is ruining the online part of the game (which is already pretty bad by modern standarts) so i am trying my best to make my version of Minecraft (and yup, i know that github is being controlled and controlled, maintaned and operated by Microsoft. I most likely will get banned from github for using their IP)

### Reason four:
I learned java and i want to make something using it. Yes, simple as that.

## Why this project may take so long, or never release
<p align=left> 

### Reason one:
This is a enhusiastic prject of a single developer. i.e. - I work for free, and don't have a team of developers to help me. 

### Reason two:
This is a rewrite of <b>all</b> Minecraft code,legacy support for Minecraft multiplayer, a modloader AND <b>it is programmed in java</b>

### Reason three:
Unfortunately i have as much time as a ***** (not so free person) and my ~~sleep~~ _everything i do in my lifeâ„¢_ schedule is such a mess that i get lucky i have like 5 hours a week to do anything. Also this: <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxbWN5nIDyA6JIQNUmg2-1eJzTsKtysTm7">a YT clip</a>

## How do i profit or gain anything from this project
<p align=left> 

### Simple anwser: 
I only gain peace and tranquility from that this project is fully open source and there is no bloat/spyware/malware and other bad things. But also i can easily mod Minecraft.

### Big legal (useless for a normal person) anwser:
I as Buklis Dmitrii Dmitrievich - which from now on will be reffered as "the creator" of a video game called "Dima's mod" am not moniteraly profiting in any way exept of donations of other people from this project.
